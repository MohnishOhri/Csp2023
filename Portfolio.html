    <h1> This is an image of the second project I have created with my partner, Mikayla. In this project we used different functions we've learned in this unit such as the random function to switch different foods the snake can eat. We also added a scoreboard which keeps a high score someone gets in which they are later on able to beat. In the end this is what we got for our results.

    <br>
    <h1> This is the third project that I created with my partner, Jacob. In this project we created an Ecard directed towards a children's hospital which provided them with an arcade game for them to play at their time at the children's hospital. We put a little message at the top of the game encouraging them to stay strong and get well soon. This is our result after spending a lot of time and the game was successfully developed.

    <h1>   Fourth Project - Obama clicker
    <br>
    <Img src=Images/Obama.png height="400"
    <br>
    <h1> This is the fourth project that I made with Jacob! I made this project using the programming language of scratch, and using block code. This is the Obama clicker in which a user can play to gain points and get upgrades to gain the most points. While you play there is music from Travis scott, Sicko mode, playing in the background and while you click Obama, it will say "I'm Barack Obama." The game ended up successful and its a pretty cool game to try out, and I'm happy with the results.

    <h1>   Fifth Project- Rover hunt using graphs
    <br>
    <Img src="Images/Graphs of rover.png" height="400"
    <br>
    <h1> These are the graphs I've discovered with my partner, Preena, in order to determine the location of the rover which was the objective of the project. At first, our graphs were mixed up so it made it hard to determine the location, but later we fixed it and found the location of the rover to be the inland forests. The images shows the graph we used in order to correspond certain conditions to determine the location as it differs in each different place.
