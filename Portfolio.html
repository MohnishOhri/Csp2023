    <h1> This is an image of the second project I have created with my partner, Mikayla. In this project we used different functions we've learned in this unit such as the random function to switch different foods the snake can eat. We also added a scoreboard which keeps a high score someone gets in which they are later on able to beat. In the end this is what we got for our results.

    <h1> This is the third project that I created with my partner, Jacob. In this project we created an Ecard directed towards a children's hospital which provided them with an arcade game for them to play at their time at the children's hospital. We put a little message at the top of the game encouraging them to stay strong and get well soon. This is our result after spending a lot of time and the game was successfully developed.
